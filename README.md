The present repository houses the frontend of the [AMEX Oracle](https://amex-oracle.herokuapp.com/), a Gradient Boosting Machine Learning model predicting whether a credit card customer will pay the credit card issuer (American Express) back or not. It doing so it leverages an industry-size data set from [American Express](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/data). It was the [final project](https://youtu.be/1PDEGIA8l0s) of a _Le Wagon_ data science bootcamp. We use a tech stack centered around Python, Streamlit and FastAPI.
